# atrigger
A very simple [A Trigger](atrigger.com) API module implementation for Node.js

[A Trigger](atrigger.com) is a task scheduling tool that can be used to do synchronous/periodic app tasks. It is a very simple and flexible alternative to using [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). I use it a lot, so I wrote this simple abstraction to make my life easier and hopefully yours too.

## Features

This module helps you create, delete, pause, and resume tasks with ease and without worrying about URI Encoding, enormous URIs, GET requests, or anything other than your actual work. Also, with this module you can check if an IP address belongs to an atrigger.com server so you can verify the authenticity of a task call.

This is basically a simple abstraction of the [A Trigger Rest API](http://atrigger.com/docs/wiki/5/rest-api-v10). The main purpose of this mini-project was to create and publish my first NPM module as I learn more and more about Node.js and JavaScript. But I didn't want to do something useless, so I built this. :smiley:

## Usage Example

`atrigger` is very simple to use:

```javascript
// Require the atrigger module
var ATrigger = require('atrigger')

// Create a new ATrigger client instance with your API Key and Secret
var tasks = new ATrigger({
  APIKey: 'API_KEY',
  APISecret: 'API_SECRET'
})

// Create a new task
tasks.create({
  url: 'http://www.krismuniz.com/',
  timeSlice: '10min',
  count: 10,
  tags: {
    'title': 'call-my-site',
    'id': 'OtftvvsJ'
  }
})
```

You can handle request errors and API responses, too.

```javascript

tasks.create({
  url: 'http://www.krismuniz.com/',
  timeSlice: '10min',
  count: 10,
}, function(err, res) {
  if (err) {
    // Handle error
  } else {
    // Do stuff with APIs response
  }
})

```

## Installation

Installing the ```atrigger``` module is as simple as installing any other npm module:

```shell
$ npm install atrigger -S
```

## API Reference

#### `create` method

Creates a new task given a specific set of parameters.

```javascript

tasks.create({
  // parameters
}, callback(err, res))

```

##### Required Parameters:

* `url` (*required*): [ `'http://www.example.com'` ] The target url that A Trigger will call it at defined TimeSlice. *Note: There is no need to use URIEncode()*

* `timeSlice` (*required*): [ `'Xminute'` | `'Xhour'` | `'Xday'` | `'Xmonth'` | `'Xyear'` ] The time frequency at which your task needs to be executed.

* `tags` (*required*): [ `object` ] An object containing tags (e.g. `{ tagname: tagvalue, tagname2: tagvalue2 }`). You need to tag your tasks for future identification and to control them using the API in the future.

##### Optional Parameters:

* `retries` (*optional*): [ `Number` ] How many times should try if your server failed(or it was down)? Default value: 3

* `count` (*optional*): [ `Number` ] How many cycles should be repeated? Read more at [count parameter](http://atrigger.com/docs/wiki/8/rest-api-v10-parameter-count).

* `first` (*optional*): When should be the first call? You are not required to set time value by default. Read more at [first parameter](http://atrigger.com/docs/wiki/10/rest-api-v10-parameter-first).

#### `delete` method

All tasks containing a specified set of tags will be deleted.

```javascript

tasks.delete({
  // parameters
}, callback(err, res))

```

##### Required Parameters:

* `tags` (*required*): [ `object` ] An object containing tags (e.g. `{ tagname: tagvalue, tagname2: tagvalue2 }`).

#### `pause` method

All currently running tasks containing a specified set of tags will be paused.

```javascript

tasks.pause({
  // parameters
}, callback(err, res))

```

##### Required Parameters:

* `tags` (*required*): [ `object` ] An object containing tags (e.g. `{ tagname: tagvalue, tagname2: tagvalue2 }`).

#### `resume` method

All currently paused tasks containing a specified set of tags will be resumed.

```javascript

tasks.resume({
  // parameters
}, callback(err, res))

```

##### Required Parameters:

* `tags` (*required*): [ `object` ] An object containing tags (e.g. `{ tagname: tagvalue, tagname2: tagvalue2 }`).
